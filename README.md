# dataStructuresAlgo
Various data structures and algorithms written in C++ and Python equivalents.

Note: These implementations are based on examples in the text: "Data Structures and Algorithms in C++" by Goodrich, 2nd Ed.
Disclaimer: They are bare bones implementations.

#### Data Structures
* ArrayQueue (Array based queue)
* ArrayStack (Array based stack) 
* BST-R (Binary Search Tree - Recursive)
* Doubly Linked List
* FixedVector (Array based container)
* LinkedQueue (Linked list based queue)
* LinkedStack (Linked list based stack)
* Singly Linked List
* SNodeList (Singly Linked List w/ Iterator)

#### Algorithms
* Mergesort
